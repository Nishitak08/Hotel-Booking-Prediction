## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Hotel booking cancellations can have a significant impact on revenue and resource planning for hotels. Predicting booking cancellations accurately can help hotels make better decisions regarding room allocation, staffing, and revenue management. In this project, we aim to develop machine learning models that can predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not based on various factors.

## Project Setup <a name="project-setup"></a>
- Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotel-booking-cancellation-prediction.git
- Navigate to the project directory using cd hotel-booking-cancellation-prediction
## Data Preprocessing <a name="data-preprocessing"></a>
- Load the dataset from the provided CSV file using pandas.
- Perform initial data inspection to identify missing values, duplicate records, and data types.
- Handle missing values and duplicates by dropping or imputing as needed.
- Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y).
## Exploratory Data Analysis <a name="exploratory-data-analysis"></a>
- Visualize the distribution of the target variable (booking cancellations).
- Explore the relationship between various features and the target variable.
- Generate visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots to gain insights.
## Feature Engineering <a name="feature-engineering"></a>
- Create new features based on domain knowledge and insights gained from EDA.
- Drop features that are deemed irrelevant or redundant for prediction.
- Scale or normalize numerical features if necessary.
## Model Selection <a name="model-selection"></a>
- Train various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- Tune hyperparameters for each model using techniques like grid search or randomized search.
- Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
## Model Evaluation <a name="model-evaluation"></a>
- Compare the performance of different models using evaluation metrics.
- Select the best-performing model based on the chosen metric (e.g., accuracy).
- Visualize model evaluation results using plots like confusion matrices.
## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
Summarize the findings of the project and the performance of the selected model in predicting hotel booking cancellations. Highlight the significance of accurate cancellation predictions for revenue optimization in the hotel industry.

## Future Work <a name="future-work"></a>
- Investigate additional features that could improve prediction accuracy.
- Fine-tune model hyperparameters further to enhance performance.
- Explore ensemble techniques to combine the strengths of multiple models.
- Deploy the selected model to a web application for real-time predictions.
